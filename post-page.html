            <p class="post-text">The course BCAEd particularly the subject Culture Education has actually taught me a lot. It had given me a hard time to catch up from the topic because I am not actually familiar with the culture of our municipality but it did not hindrance me to learn more and adapt to it. Hence, I am expecting a lot and I know that my learnings will not stop here and I will further discover more to it. </p>
            <p class="post-text">Hello, everyone! I am Regine Anne D. Vargas! One of the pioneers of the new course here in Polytechnic College of Botolan, the Bachelor of Culture and Arts Education. I am a second year student and all I can say is that my journey as a BCAEd student is a roller coaster one. It had me a rough experiences at first because of its offered four expertise which are Music, Arts, Theater and Dance. The same way as MAPEH. Moreover, it also gave me a challenging two semesters as I learned a lot especially in Music because we did a recital to it. We have learned to read musical notes as well as play a flute. </p>
            <p class="post-text">"Learning by doing", these are the words that John Dewey left us. It also applies to our course because we are more of application. By doing these four expertise majors, we are tend to learn new skills that requires application to it. Good thing that we, the BCAEd students are willing to learn new things.</p>
            <p class="post-text">Let's move on to the subject Culture Education. This is also one of our major subjects because we are also learning everything about our culture. Not only the culture here in our municipality but also the cultures of other places. I have learned about the plural society and multicultural. Additional to it, what I have really love is the T'boli community aside from Ayta community. I really learned about their traditional weaving technique which gave me a "wow" impact. Just imagine how diverse our culture is and how unique each and everyone. </p>
            <p class="post-text">Culture education is very engaging especially that we are able to visit museums like Balin Pamana and we also got a chance to be a curator, as they said that it's either of the two; tourism-related work or being a MAPEH teacher which are both a good work. Going back to to museums, in one of our Arts Major, we are also tasked to do our own exhibit.</p>
            <p class="post-text">With that being said, the course and the topic played their important roles on my progress and growth. I have gained knowledge and more experiences. I can say that this roller coaster ride are all worth it now and so is in the future.</p>

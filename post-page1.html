            <p class="post-text">Culture and Arts in Plural Society has given me an opportunity to explore different cultural artforms in the Philippines. I would say this subject has taught me very well in terms of understanding the importance of arts in our Society and how it shapes us to be artistic in the most creative way. Art is linked in the most fundamental sense of ourselves. Through the ages, art has creatively preserved history by offering a variety of perspectives and scenarios. Additionally, art has played a significant role in heralding social change by voicing viewpoints that were discordant with the status order.</p>

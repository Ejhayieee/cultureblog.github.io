                <p class="post-description">The course BCAEd particularly the subject Culture Education has actually taught me a lot. It had given me a hard time to catch up from the topic because I am not actually familiar with the culture of our municipality but it did not hindrance me to learn more and adapt to it. Hence, I am expecting a lot and I know that my learnings will not stop here and I will further discover more to it. </p>

                <p class="post-description">Culture and Arts in Plural Society has given me an opportunity to explore different cultural artforms in the Philippines. I would say this subject has taught me very well in terms of understanding the importance of arts in our Society and how it shapes us to be artistic in the most creative way. Art is linked in the most fundamental sense of ourselves. Through the ages, art has creatively preserved history by offering a variety of perspectives and scenarios. Additionally, art has played a significant role in heralding social change by voicing viewpoints that were discordant with the status order.</p>

The subject thought me a lot of different culture related stuff that involves traditions, expressions, and the culture within a society. CulEd help me to broaden my knowledge about ethnocentrism, xenocentrism, cultural relativism and as well as the two components of culture which are the tangible and intangible.

                <p class="post-description">Teaching about cultures in a diverse society involves making people aware of different traditions and languages. We aim to include everyone by using materials from various cultures, fostering communication skills across cultural boundaries, and encouraging respect for differences. Critical thinking about cultural issues is promoted, along with a sense of global citizenship by connecting local cultures to the broader world. Celebrating various cultural events and integrating cultural education into policies further enhances a harmonious community that values diversity.</p>
